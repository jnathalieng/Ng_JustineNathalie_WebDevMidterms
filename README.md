## Squeezeit Webpage (Homepage, and Character Page) 
SqueezeIt Website Project (Homepage & Character Page)
This project showcases a fully responsive, grid-based website developed for the SqueezeIt brand. It includes two completed HTML5 pages: a Homepage and a Character Page, both built using semantic HTML tags and a responsive CSS Grid layout. The site is designed to scale and adapt across all screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The character page features six original, scalable SVG icons—each representing a unique juice-themed character—created in Adobe Illustrator and styled with CSS animations.
