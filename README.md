## Squeezeit Webpage (Homepage, and Character Page) 
This project features a responsive, grid-based website designed for the Squeezit brand, including both a homepage and a character page. It includes a custom set of six branded, scalable SVG icons—each representing a unique character flavor—originally created in Adobe Illustrator. The layout is built with a responsive grid system to ensure optimal viewing across all screen sizes.

## Character Icons
Berry Bop – a strawberry-banana flavored character
Grippy Gloop – grape flavor with a gooey personality 
Tiki Tango – tropical pineapple mango combo 
Sunny Peel – bright and citrusy orange 
Mysti Swirl – four-seasons flavor with a magical swirl 
Apple Dabble – sweet and classic apple design
